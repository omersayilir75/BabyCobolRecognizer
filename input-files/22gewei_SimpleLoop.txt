      * SIMPLY LOOP FROM 1 TO 9 INCLUSIVE
           LOOP VARYING X FROM 1 TO 9
                DISPLAY X
           END.
      * THE END VALUE OF X SHOULD BE AN INCLUSIVE ONE, SO IT IS 9
           DISPLAY "L1 END: " X.

      * LOOP FROM 1 TO 9 INCLUSIVE WITH A STEP VALUE OF 2! I.E. ONLY PRINTS ODD NUMBERS
           LOOP VARYING X FROM 1 TO 9 BY 2
               DISPLAY X
           END.
      * THE END VALUE OF X IS STILL 9
           DISPLAY "L2 END: " X.

      * LOOP FROM 1 TO 9 INCLUSIVE WITH A STEP VALUE OF 3! SO WE ONLY PRINT VALUES THAT SATISFY 3A + 1 FOR ANY POSITIVE INTEGER A.

           DISPLAY "L3 END: " X.

      * NESTED VARIES DO NOT WORK THE SAME AS NESTED LOOPS: HERE WE PRINT (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

      * THE VARYING CONDITION FOR X IS STILL TRUE AFTER IT BECOMES 4, BUT IS FALSE FOR Y. THIS WILL PRINT (4,3)

           LOOP

      * LOOP WITH JUST VARYING CLAUSE (INFINITE LOOP), AND A WHILE WITH AN UNTIL (PRINTS 5 4 3 2)
           MOVE 5 TO X.
