# BabyCobolRecognizer

This repository contains the code for a recognizer and a negative sample generator for the language BabyCobol.



Both tools rely on an ANTLR parser, the parser found in  `src/gen` was generated with the BabyCobol grammar found in the file `grammars/22goingmerry/BabyCobol.g4`.

The negative sample generator is based on the word mutation method described by Raselimo, Taljaard and Fischer in their paper _Breaking parsers: mutation-based generation of programs with guaranteed syntax errors_ [[1]](#1).
